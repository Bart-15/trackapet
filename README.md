## TrackaPet App Overview

<p>Welcome to TrackAPet! This app offers a comprehensive pet management system allowing you to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) pet records with ease.</p>
<p>
One of the standout features is user can generate and download QR codes for each pet. These QR codes provide quick access to detailed pet information.</p>
<p>Once your pet's QR code is generated, users can seamlessly access the pet's information via a public route. Additionally, I integrated a notification system to alert owners in case their pet goes missing. However, to ensure fair usage, I implemented a limit of three notifications per day. If this limit is exceeded, users will need to wait for 24 hours before sending additional notifications to the owner of the pet.</p>
